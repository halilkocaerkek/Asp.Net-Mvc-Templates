# Asp.Net-Mvc-Templates

In this project, I tried to see how I can speed up the software processes by using the Text Template and ASP.Net scaffolding technologies int the Visual Studio.

## Asp.net Scafffolding 

ASP.NET Scaffolding is a code generation framework for ASP.NET Web applications. Visual Studio includes pre-installed code generators for MVC and Web API projects. You add scaffolding to your project when you want to quickly add code that interacts with data models.

When you add a view or controller into your application, you are using asp net.scaffolding. But your code generated with default code templates. You can change the CSS files to change the view of your application. If you want to change the behavior of your application you need to more than this. The theme you use will always differ from the default theme.

You can replace default code generator of asp.net scaffolding to support your application design.
